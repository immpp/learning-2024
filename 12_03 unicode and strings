unicode and strings Feb 10 2024

12.3

representing simple strings
	each char is represented by a # between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
	we refer to 8 bits of memory as a byte of memory
	the ord() function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character

eg {case sensitive}
>>>print(ord('H'))

unicode is universal code

UTF-8 is everything, now the best

in pthon3 all strings are unicode

Python strings to bytes
	when we talk to an external resource like a network socket, we send bytes, so we need to encode python3 strings into a given character encoding
	when we need to read data from an external resource, we must decode it, based on the character set so it is properly represented in python3 as a string
	encode() // decode()

by default assumes utf-8... decode(utf-8)
almost never have to tell it what it is

decode goes from bytes to unicode

encode, turning to bytes, sending in utf-8

sounds more complex than it is

12.4 retrieving web pages

using urllip in Python

import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error

fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('https://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt')
for line in fhand:
	print(line.decode().strip())

______

import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error

fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('https://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt')

counts = dict()
for line in fhand:
	words = line.decode().strip()
	for word in words:
		counts[words] = counts.get(word, 0) +1

print(counts)

12.5 Parsing web pages // web scraping

what is web scraping?
	when a program or script pretend to be abrowser and retrieves web pages, looks at them, extracts information, and then looks at more web pages
	search engines scrape web pages, we this "spidering the web" or "web crawling"

WHY scrape?
	pull data, particularly social data, who links to who
	get your own data back out of some system that has no "export capability"
	monitor a site for new information
	spider the web to make a database for a search engine

Scraping web pages
	there is controversy about web page scraping and some sites hate it
	republishing copyrighted information is not allowed
	violating terms of servcie is not allowed
