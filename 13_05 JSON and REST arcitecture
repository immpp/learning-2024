JSON and REST arcitecture Feb 11 2024

JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

JSON represents datas as nested lists and dictionaries

import json
data = '''{
	"name" : "Chuck",
	"phone" : { 
		"type" : "intl",
		"number" : "+1 734 303 4456"
	},
	"email" : {
		"hide" : "yes"
	}
}'''

info = json.loads(data)
print('Name:',info.["name"])
print('Hide:',info["email"]["hide"])

think of like a tree

different in JSON, no start no end and no atrribute as well as no text area, different in nature to XML

.loads(), load s, load from string

what we get back is a python dictionary, as name and phone as key words,  can pull out the values

dict within a dict

[]list {}dict, JSON represents data as nested LISTS and DICTIONARIES

info = json.loads(input)
print('User count:', len(info))
for item in info:
	print('Name', item['name'])
	print('Id', item['id'])
	print('Attribute', item['x'])

JSON is simpler, so the code to write it is simpler

a list of dictionaries
