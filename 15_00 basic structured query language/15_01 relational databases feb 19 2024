Relational Databases
storing rows and columns in tables

applying cleverness to how we access data

database - contains many tables
relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes
tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represent an object like a person or music track
attribute (also column or field) - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row

strong rules about the content

SQL
structured queryt language is the language we use to issue command to the database
	create a table
	retrieve some data
	insert data
	delete data

python + sql

python good with unstructured data

CRUD - create read update delete
