database design is an art form
avoid bad mistakes

data table relationship model

building a data model
	draw a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
	basic rule: dont puit the same string data in twice, use a relationship instead
	when there is only one thing in the real world there should only be one copy of that thing in the database

replication of data

x belongs to y belongs to z

draw out and map
