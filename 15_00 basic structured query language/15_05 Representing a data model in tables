15_05 Representing a data model in tables
Feb 20 2024

logical model into a physical model

take each table and the relationship of the table and augment them

primary key - way to identify each unique row

table > primary key > logical key > foreign key

create a naming convention

primary key starting point
foreign key ending point

logical key, unique thing we might use to look up data

CREATE TABLE Genre (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	name TEXT
	)

15_06 inserting relational data

okay to have replication as long as it is numbers that point to the data

15_07 reconstructing data with join
Feb 20 2024

relational power

by removing the replicated data and replacing it with references to a single copy of each bit of data we build a "web" of information that the relational database can read through very quickly, even for large amounts of data

often when you want some data it comes from a number of tables linked by these foreign keys

SQL getting weird:

SELECT Album.title, Artist.name FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.artist_id = Artist.id

ON clause vs WHERE clause

SELECT Album.title, Album.artist_id, Artist.id, Artist.name FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.artist_id = Artist.id

JOIN is glueing these tables together

SELECT Track.title, Genre.name FROM Track JOIN Genre ON Track.genre_id = Genre.id

SELECT Track.title, Genre.name >>> what we want to see
FROM Track JOIN Genre 		   >>> the tables that have the data
ON Track.genre_id = Genre.id   >>> how the tables are linked

without ON clause it combines all relevent combinations

indenting doesnt matter in SQL

complexity continues

SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist ON Track.genre_id = Genre.id AND Track.album_id = Album.id AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id

SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name 
>>>> what we want to see

FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist 
>>>>> the table that holds the data

ON Track.genre_id = Genre.id AND Track.album_id = Album.id AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id
>>>> how the tables are linked

***reconstruct the replication // dont store it

carefully construct a data model that makes sense
